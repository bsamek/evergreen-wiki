The Project and Distro settings pages can be found at the right side
dropdown on the navigation menu. All users can access the distro
settings page and Project Admins and Superusers can access the project
settings page.

Types of Special Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Superusers
''''''''''

Superusers can be set in the Evergreen settings file and have access to
all Evergreen projects and Evergreen distro settings.

Project Administrators
''''''''''''''''''''''

Project Administrators have access to specific projects that they
maintain and can be set by an Evergreen Superuser in the Project
Settings page for that specific project. After adding the userâ€™s
Evergreen username to the list of Administrators, that user will be able
to access the Project Settings page for that project only and modify
repository information, access settings, alerts, and keys.

Project Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Project Settings file displays information about the Project itself,
as well as configurable fields for managing your project

There are two types of users that can view and edit these settings:
Superusers and Project Admins. ##### General Project Settings If a
Project Administrator wants Evergreen to discontinue or start tracking a
project, it can be changed via the Enabled and Disabled radio buttons.
The display name field corresponds to what users will see in the project
dropdown on the navigation bar. Admins can change the location or name
of the config file in the repository if they would like to have
Evergreen run tests using a different project file located elsewhere, or
if they move the config file. The batch time corresponds to the interval
of time (in minutes) that Evergreen should wait in between activating
the latest version.

Repository Info
'''''''''''''''

Admins can modify which GitHub repository the project points to and
change the owner, repository name, or branch that is to be tracked by
Evergreen.

Access and Admin Settings
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Admins can set a project as private or public. A private project can
only be seen by logged in users. A public project is viewable to those
who are not logged in as well. To set a Project Administrator edit the
Admin list (which can only be viewable by Superusers or Project Admins
for the project) for the probject by adding the Evergreen username to
the list and saving the project settings.

commit passes.

file via an expansion.

Inter-project dependencies
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Users can specify that commits to another project (the "upstream" project) 
will triggers builds in their project (the "downstream" project). Configure
triggers in the downstream project from the project configuration page. Click
"NEW TRIGGER".

Options:

- Project: The upstream project.
- Date cutoff: Do not trigger a downstream build if a user manually schedules a build older than this number of days.
- Level: Trigger based on either a task or a build completing.
- Variant and task regexes: Trigger based on these variants (if build-level) or variants and tasks (if task-level) completing.
- Command: If you would like to use `generate.tasks`, specify a command to run in your project to generate the JSON document to pass to `generate.tasks`. Only a command or a definition file may be specified.
- Definition file: The path to the downstream project's config file. This may be the same as the main project configuration file but does not have to be.
- Alias: Run a subset of tasks by specifying an alias. Otherwise, all tasks run.

Distro Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Distros page allows all users to see all available distros a project
can run tasks on. As a superuser or admin, one can also add new distro
configurations to be used by other users.
