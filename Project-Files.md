Project files are how you tell Evergreen what to do.
They contain a set of tasks and variants to run those tasks on, and are stored within the repository they test.
Project files are written in a simple YAML config language.

### Examples
Before reading onward, you should check out some example project files:

1. [Sample tutorial project file](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/sample.git)
2. [Evergreen's own project file](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/blob/master/self-tests.yml)
3. [The MongoDB Tools project file](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-tools/blob/master/common.yml)
4. [The MongoDB Server project file](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/etc/evergreen.yml)

Though some of them are quite large, the pieces that make them up are very simple.

### Basic Features

#### Tasks
A task is any discrete job you want Evergreen to run, typically a build, test suite, or deployment of some kind.
A task is made up of a list of commands/functions.
Currently we include commands for interacting with git, running shell scripts, parsing test results, and manipulating Amazon s3.

For example, a couple tasks might look like:
```yaml
tasks:
- name: compile
  depends_on: []
  commands:
    - command: git.get_project
      params:
        directory: src
    - func: "compile and upload to s3" 
- name: passing_test 
  depends_on: 
  - name: compile
  commands:
    - func: "download compiled artifacts"
    - func: "run a task that passes"
```

Notice that each task contains:

1. A name
2. A set of dependencies of other tasks
3. A list of commands and/or functions

#### Commands
Commands are the building blocks of tasks.
Each command has a set of parameters that it can take.

#####shell.exec
This command runs a shell script.

Example:
```yaml
- command: shell.exec
  params:
    working_dir: src
    script: |
      echo "this is a 2nd command in the function!"
      ls
```

Parameters:
* `script`: the script to run 
* `working_dir`: the directory to execute the shell script in
* `background`: if set to true, does not wait for the script to exit before running the next commands
* `silent`: if set to true, does not log any shell output during execution; useful to avoid leaking sensitive info
* `continue_on_err`: if set to true, causes command to exit with success regardless of the script's exit code

#####shell.track
This command starts up process tracking so that all started processes get cleaned up on task completion.
Used with `shell.cleanup`.

Example:
```yaml
- command: shell.track
```
This function takes no parameters.

#####shell.cleanup
This command cleans up all process trees created during execution.
Used with `shell.track`.

Example:
```yaml
- command: shell.cleanup
```
This function takes no parameters.

#####git.get_project
This command clones the tracked project repository into a given directory.

NOTE: this command currently only supports clone over SSH.
Make sure your keys are set up #TODO

Example:
```yaml
- command: git.get_project
  params:
    directory: src
```

Parameters:
* `dir`: the directory to clone into

#####git.apply_patch
Applies a user patch to the tracked project in the given directory.

NOTE: This will be rolled into the `git.get_project` command by `1.0.0`.

Example:
```yaml
- command: git.apply_patch
  params:
    directory: src
```

Parameters:
* `dir`: the directory to apply the diff in (same as `git.get_project`)

#####s3.put
This command uploads a file to Amazon s3, for use in later tasks or distribution.

Example:
```yaml
- command: s3.put
  params:
    aws_key: ${aws_key}
    aws_secret: ${aws_secret}
    local_file: src/mongodb-binaries.tgz
    remote_file: mongodb-mongo-master/${build_variant}/${revision}/binaries/mongo-${build_id}.${ext|tgz}
    bucket: mciuploads
    permissions: public-read
    content_type: ${content_type|application/x-gzip}
    display_name: Binaries
```

Parameters:
* `aws_key`: your AWS key (use expansions to keep this a secret)
* `aws_secret`: your AWS secret (use expansions to keep this a secret)
* `local_file`: the local file to post
* `remote_file`: the ec2 path to post the file to
* `bucket`: the ec2 bucket to use
* `permissions`: the ec2 permissions string to upload with
* `content_type`: the MIME type of the file
* `display_name`: the display string for the file in the Evergreen UI

#####gotest.parse
This command parses Go test results and sends them to the API server.
It accepts files generated by saving the output of the `go test -v` command to a file.

E.g. In a preceding shell.exec command, run  `go test -v > result.suite`

Example:
```yaml
- command: gotest.parse_files
  params: 
    files: ["src/*.suite"]
```

Parameters:
* `files`: a list of files (or blobs) to parse and upload

#####attach.results
This command parses results in Evergreen's JSON test result format and posts them to the API server.

#TODO: outline format

Example:
```yaml
- command: attach.results
  params:
    file_location: src/report.json
```

Parameters:
* `file_location`: a .json file to parse and upload


#####attach.x_unit_results
This command parses results in the widely-used XUnit format and posts them to the API server.

Example:
```yaml
- command: attach.results
  params:
    file_location: src/results.xml
```

Parameters:
* `file_location`: a .xml file to parse and upload

#### Build Variants
Build variants are a set of tasks run on a given platform.
