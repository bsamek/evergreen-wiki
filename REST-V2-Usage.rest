General Functionality
=====================

A note on authentication
------------------------

Many of the these REST endpoints do not require authentication to access, but some do. These will return a 404 if no authentication headers are sent, if the username is invalid, or if the API key is incorrect. Use the "user" and "api_key" fields from the https://evergreen.mongodb.com/settings page to set two headers, `Api-User` and `Api-Key`.


Content Type and Communication
------------------------------
The API accepts and returns all results in JSON. Some resources also allow 
URL parameters to provide additional specificity to a request.

Errors
------
When an error is encountered during a request, the API returns a JSON 
object with the HTTP status code and a message describing the error of the form:

::

  {
   "status": <http_status_code>,
   "error": <error message>
  }

Pagination
----------
API Routes that fetch many objects return them in a JSON array and support paging 
through subsets of the total result set. When there are additional results for the 
query, access to them is populated in a `Link HTTP header <https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkHeader>`_. This header has the form: 

::

 "Link" : <http://<EVERGREEN_HOST>/rest/v2/path/to/resource?start_at=<pagination_key>&limit=<objects_per_page>; rel="next"

 <http://<EVERGREEN_HOST>/rest/v2/path/to/resource?start_at=<pagination_key>&limit=<objects_per_page>; rel="prev"

Dates
-----

Date fields are returned and accepted in ISO-8601 UTC extended format. They contain 
3 fractional seconds with a ‘dot’ separator. 

Empty Fields
------------

A returned object will always contain its complete list of fields. Any field 
that does not have an associated value will be filled with JSON's null value. 

Resources
=========

The API has a series of implemented objects that it returns depending on the 
queried endpoint. 

Task
----

The task is a basic unit of work understood by evergreen. They usually comprise 
a suite of tests or generation of a set of artifacts.

``````````````````

::

 PATCH /projects/<project_id>

Modify an existing project (restricted to project admins). 
If enabling the project, will attempt to enable webhooks, and enable PR testing and the commit queue if specified.

Copy a Project
`````````````

::

 POST /projects/<project_id>/copy?new_project=<new_project_id>

Restricted to admins of the original project.
Create a new project that is identical to indicated project--this project is initially disabled (PR testing and CommitQueue also initially disabled). The unique identifier is passed to the query parameter ``new_project`` and is required.

Project variables, aliases, and subscriptions also copied. Returns the new project (but not variables/aliases/subscriptions).

TaskReliability
----------

Task Reliability success scores are aggregated task execution statistics for a given project. Statistics can be grouped by time period (days) and by task, variant, distro combinations.

The score is based on the lower bound value of a `Binomial proportion confidence interval <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval>`_.

In this case, the equation is a `Wilson score interval <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson%20score%20interval%20with%20continuity%20correction>`_:

|Wilson score interval with continuity correction|

 In statistics, a binomial proportion confidence interval is a confidence interval for the probability of success calculated from the outcome of a series of success–failure experiments (Bernoulli trials). In other words, a binomial proportion confidence interval is an interval estimate of a success probability p when only the number of experiments n and the number of successes nS are known.

The advantage of using a confidence interval of this sort is that the computed value takes the number of test into account. The lower the number of test, the greater the margin of error. This results in a lower success rate score for the cases where there are fewer test results.

During the evaluation of this algorithm, 22 consecutive test passes are required before a success  score of .85 is reached (with a significance level / α of ``0.05``).

Users
--------------

::

   POST /users/<user_id>/permissions

Grants the user specified by user_id the permissions in the request body. Note that usage of this endpoint requires that the requesting user have security to modify roles. The format of the body is:
::

   {
     "resource_type": "project",
     "resources": ["project1", "project2"],
     "permissions": {
        "project_tasks: 30,
        "project_patches": 10
     }
   }

* resource_type - the type of resources for which permission is granted. Must be one of "project", "distro", or "superuser"
* resources - an array of strings representing what resources the access is for. For a resource_type of project, this will be a list of projects. For a resource_type of distro, this will be a list of distros.
* permissions - an object whose keys are the permission keys returned by the /permissions endpoint above, and whose values are the levels of access to grant for that permission (also returned by the /permissions endpoint)

::

   GET /users/<user_id>/permissions

Retrieves all permissions for the user. The format of the response is:
::
   [
     {
       "type": "project",
       "permissions": {
         "project1": {

         },

          "distro_settings: 10
         }
       }
     }
   ]

* type - the type of resources for which the listed permissions apply. Will be "project", "distro", or "superuser"
* permissions - an object whose keys are the resources for which the user has permissions. Note that these objects will often have many keys, since logged-in users have basic permissions to every project and distro. The values in the keys are objects representing the permissions that the user has for that resource, identical to the format of the permissions field in the POST /users/<user_id>/permissions API.

::

   DELETE /users/<user_id>/permissions

Deletes all permissions of a given type for a user by deleting their roles of that type. Note that usage of this endpoint requires that the requesting user have security to modify roles. The format of the body is:
::

   {
     "resource_type": "project"
   }

* resource_type - the type of resources for which to delete permissions. Must be one of "project", "distro", "superuser", or "all". "all" will revoke all permissions for the user
