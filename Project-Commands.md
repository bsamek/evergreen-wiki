This page is a glossary of Evergreen's supported task commands.

####shell.exec
This command runs a shell script.

```yaml
- command: shell.exec
  params:
    working_dir: src
    script: |
      echo "this is a 2nd command in the function!"
      ls
```

Parameters:
* `script`: the script to run 
* `working_dir`: the directory to execute the shell script in
* `background`: if set to true, does not wait for the script to exit before running the next commands
* `silent`: if set to true, does not log any shell output during execution; useful to avoid leaking sensitive info
* `continue_on_err`: if set to true, causes command to exit with success regardless of the script's exit code

####git.get_project
This command clones the tracked project repository into a given directory.

NOTE: this command currently only supports clone over SSH.
Make sure your GitHub ssh keys are set up in your target distros.

```yaml
- command: git.get_project
  params:
    directory: src
```

Parameters:
* `dir`: the directory to clone into

####git.apply_patch
Applies a user patch to the tracked project in the given directory.

NOTE: This will be rolled into the `git.get_project` command eventually.

```yaml
- command: git.apply_patch
  params:
    directory: src
```

Parameters:
* `dir`: the directory to apply the diff in (same as `git.get_project`)

####s3.put
This command uploads a file to Amazon s3, for use in later tasks or distribution.

```yaml

    aws_key: ${aws_key}
    aws_secret: ${aws_secret}
    local_file: src/mongodb-binaries.tgz
    remote_file: mongodb-mongo-master/${build_variant}/${revision}/binaries/mongo-${build_id}.${ext|tgz}
    bucket: mciuploads
    permissions: public-read
    content_type: ${content_type|application/x-gzip}
    display_name: Binaries
```

Parameters:
* `aws_key`: your AWS key (use expansions to keep this a secret)
* `aws_secret`: your AWS secret (use expansions to keep this a secret)
* `local_file`: the local file to post
* `remote_file`: the ec2 path to post the file to
* `bucket`: the ec2 bucket to use

####gotest.parse
This command parses Go test results and sends them to the API server.
It accepts files generated by saving the output of the `go test -v` command to a file.

E.g. In a preceding shell.exec command, run  `go test -v > result.suite`

```yaml
- command: gotest.parse_files
  params: 
    files: ["src/*.suite"]
```

Parameters:
* `files`: a list of files (or blobs) to parse and upload

####attach.results

The format is as follows:
```json

    "results":[
    {
        "status":"pass",
            "test_file":"test_1",
            "exit_code":0,
            "elapsed":0.32200002670288086, //end-start

    },
    {
        "etc":"..."
    },
    ]
}
```

```yaml

  params:
    file_location: src/report.json
```

* `file_location`: a .json file to parse and upload


####attach.x_unit_results
This command parses results in the widely-used XUnit format and posts them to the API server.
